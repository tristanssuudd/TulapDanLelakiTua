# Tulap dan Lelaki Tua
A North Sulawesi Folklore-based 3D game made with Unity as a capstone project to complete Object Oriented Software Development certification. All aspects of production are made by me without help of generative AI. Gameplay includes lane-based runner with dynamic obstacle generation, collectible/powerup system (coins, speed boosts, health), procedurally generated terrain and obstacle placement.
